        Many issues within the codebases belong to <Term type="term">classes</Term> of issues rather than being
        specific, one-off issues. The following sections attempt to describe those classes of issues so that the
        documentation sections for each module in the codebase can link to the definitions rather than repeating them.

      <Paragraph>
        When the codebases were primarily written in Java, the ancient version of Java provided on Android made it very
        labour intensive to write <Term type="term">data classes</Term>. A
        <Term type="term">data class</Term>
        is essentially a class used to hold immutable data and has no "behaviour". Writing these by hand in the ancient
        Java version available on Android means writing lots of methods by hand in order to get pleasant behaviour with
        regards to comparing values of the classes for equality, hashing values of the class to insert into maps and
        sets, and printing values of the classes during debugging. The
        <LinkExternal target="https://github.com/google/auto/">Google AutoValue</LinkExternal>
        package provides annotations to generate data classes without having to manually write all of the boilerplate.
        However, nowadays, the Android codebases have moved to using Kotlin as the primary implementation language, and
        the language has direct support for writing data classes without needing an external library. The issue here is
        that the various codebases do still have some old <Term type="class">AutoValue</Term>-generated Java classes,
        and haven't migrated to plain Kotlin data classes.

      <Paragraph>
        The Android UI is single-threaded in the sense that all updates made to UI elements onscreen must be made by
        code running on the <Term type="term">Android UI thread</Term>. Code must not
        <Term type="term">block</Term>
        on the UI thread (ie. run or wait for a long period of time without terminating) because this will cause the UI
        to become unresponsive and may result in the system offering to kill the application. This means that if a long
        running operation must occur (such as sending a request to a server and waiting for the response), the operation
        must be scheduled to run on a background thread. Of course, most long-running operations perform actions such as
        publishing status updates; an operation might periodically publish updates that indicate for how much longer the
        operation is likely to continue running. Because it's only possible to update a user interface from the UI
        thread, it's therefore necessary to have some way for a background thread to schedule code that will run on the
        UI thread at the earliest possible opportunity after a status update is published.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Briefly, the class of issue described here arises from code being scheduled to run on the UI thread that carries
        a reference to a UI element, but the Android UI system destroys the UI element before the code is allowed to
        run. The code then runs as scheduled, but crashes the app because the UI element has been invalidated. This is
        commonly seen where a long-running background operation publishes events to indicate the state of the operation,
        and code is scheduled to run on the UI thread in response to these events in order to perform operations such as
        updating onscreen progress bars, and etc.

        This, sadly, is a fundamental design flaw in Android (and the entire lifecycle system is also arguably a
        fundamental design flaw). The above is a common design pattern used in all other UI libraries (such
        as <LinkExternal target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)">Swing</LinkExternal>,
        <LinkExternal target="https://openjfx.io/">JavaFX</LinkExternal>,

        <LinkExternal target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">.NET</LinkExternal>
        UI systems, and so on). The main design flaw in this case is that the Android system is allowed to execute code
        on the UI thread <Term type="term">before the user-scheduled UI code can run</Term>. Even on other systems that
        are allowed to invalidate UI elements in this manner, operations on invalid UI elements are simply treated as <Term type="term">
        no-ops
      </Term> and simply do not cause crashes.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The primary method that we've started to use instead is to force events to be delivered onto the UI thread, and
        code can execute immediately on the UI thread to respond to them, rather than code being scheduled to run later.
        We've
        <LinkFootnote target="c16f4f1e-08a0-4a83-8da2-62a82173aa15"/>
        used the scheduling methods provided by
        <LinkExternal target="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid">RxAndroid</LinkExternal>
        to control event streams in most cases.

      This section provides a complete listing of all of the caches used in the codebases. A
      <Term type="term">cache</Term>
      in this case is strictly defined to be a mechanism where the application stores some piece of data either in
      memory or on disk in order to avoid having to execute a more expensive operation to fetch data from the network.
      It should be understood as a mechanism purely intended to improve
      <Term type="term">performance</Term>
      and
      <Term type="term">responsiveness</Term>. A cache is typically a time-limited mechanism where the contents of the
      cache are expected to be volatile; if the cache doesn't contain an entry for some required piece of data, then the
      data can simply be fetched and cached, and the application will continue to work without issue. Data is typically
      automatically evicted from the cache when a time limit expires. This is
      <Term type="emphatic">not</Term>
      the same as code that keeps a copy of some important piece of data in order to be able to operate without access
      to the original data. A good example of the latter is the audio book player working from a manifest that the
      application has downloaded and saved at an earlier date - the audio book player would not be able to work without
      network connectivity if the manifest had not been downloaded and saved. This is not an issue of performance, but
      an issue of being able to actually do work at all if the network connection is down.

            For historical reasons, the accounts database requires that
            <Term type="term">at least one</Term>
            account must exist at any given time. This is because the support for multiple accounts was added (badly) in
            version 2.0 of the application, and was rewritten from the ground up for the
            <LinkExternal target="https://libraryforall.org/">Library For All</LinkExternal>
            fork of the codebase without there being resources available to redesign the UI to properly support multiple
            (or zero) accounts. The simplest way to avoid having to do the UI work was to ensure that at least one
            account was always available for the UI to display.

            Book IDs are used to uniquely identify books within the application. Book IDs are produced by hashing the
            OPDS identifiers of books within a feed. Unfortunately, if two accounts both publish the same book, there
            will be a book ID collision and the app will be confused as to which account the book belongs.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            This could also, theoretically, cause Adobe DRM issues as the wrong credentials will be used for book
            operations.

            Because all of these operations happen on a single background thread, the operations cannot be interleaved:
            If you trigger a book borrowing operation, you cannot perform an account login until the book borrowing and
            download has completed. This kind of single threaded operation keeps the code simple, but is costly in terms
            of responsiveness.

            The contents of this module define an API for safely displaying error information onscreen in a way that
            indicates that the message text has been properly formatted and translated. However, the UI now never
            displays information in this way. Instead, an error details page is used that deliberately shows
            untranslated text because people tend to send screenshots of error messages to developers. This module could
            be removed.

          <Paragraph>
            The bookmark policy class is overengineered and unnecessarily complicated. The historical reason for this
            was that the mechanism for storing bookmarks, parsing bookmarks, and sending and receiving bookmarks to/from
            the server used to be deeply intertwined and contained within a single method (!) in the R1 reader activity.
            As part of refactoring, these separate concerns were broken up into their own implementation classes and
            moved into this module. At the time, due to the complexity of the code, we were unsure as to exactly when
            and why the application would choose to send or receive bookmarks. The policy was reverse-engineered as much
            as it could be, and a pure functional implementation of the policy was placed into a class with the
            intention of refining and expanding the policy at a later date. It turns out that the only policy the
            application needs is "send all bookmarks as soon as a bookmark is created" and "receive all bookmarks when a
            book is opened". The complexity in the current policy is entirely unwarranted.

            Error reports are sent via email with log files as zipped attachments. This requires devices to have working
            email configurations and many do not. It also requires humans to manually forward error reports between
            developers. This should be replaced with a mechanism that uploads log files to a server over HTTP, with some

            The module makes heavy use of Mockito in order to mock dependency classes during tests. Unfortunately, this
            sometimes results in tests with hundreds of lines of setup code, as all dependencies must be laboriously
            mocked one method at a time. We have made some inroads towards replacing these with hand-written fake
            classes, or even just using the real implementations of dependencies for tests. Even so, the test suite
            currently represents a large maintenance burden whenever any kind of refactoring is performed.

          <Paragraph>
            The current UI uses Android Fragments to construct the catalog interface. The previous version of the UI
            used Android Activities. In order to have the fewest surprises in terms of implementation, the old
            Activity-based UI was more or less translated directly to Fragment form. That is, each loaded feed is an
            instance of a Fragment, and the Android Fragment backstack is used to store the history of feeds through
            which the user has navigated. Unfortunately, the Android Fragment backstack is fraught with issues and
            cannot be adequately controlled to give a pleasant user experience.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Additionally, our Fragment instances are stateful, and this state can be invalidated. For example, if the
            user navigates to a feed in account <Term type="constant">A</Term>, and then navigates to a feed in account <Term type="constant">
            B</Term>, this will result in a fragment
            <Term type="constant">F</Term>
            being placed on the backstack that has a reference to information in account <Term type="constant">A</Term>.
            If the user then navigates to the settings screen and deletes account <Term type="constant">A</Term>, the
            Fragment <Term type="constant">F</Term> now contains references to the deleted account
            <Term type="constant">A</Term>. Any attempt to move <Term type="constant">F</Term> back to the foreground
            and interact with it in any meaningful way will almost certainly crash the application. The current
            unpleasant workaround we apply is to simply clear the entire backstack whenever an account is deleted. This
            is why the user is unceremoniously thrown back to the catalog screen whenever they delete an account.

            The proper way to implement this would be to store the navigation history as a navigable data structure in a
            ViewModel, and use one stateless Fragment instance instead of multiple instances.

            The "Books" tab (the tab showing books that the user currently has loaned or downloaded) only shows books
            from the most recent account. The historical reason for this is that support for multiple accounts was added
            in very early versions of the application in a very haphazard way. In early versions of the application, the
            application was almost entirely restarted to point at a new account each time the user switched accounts,
            and there was no way to access data from accounts other than the current account. The application was
            rewritten to properly support multiple accounts many years ago, but the "Books" tab still only has a user
            interface that displays books from one account rather than from all accounts. This has, effectively, turned
            what was a serious implementation bug into a conscious UI design decision.

            The audio player appears to have problems storing bookmarks. The most likely cause of this issue is a
            combination of the application eagerly storing bookmarks in response to player position update events, and
            the underlying player publishing invalid position updates. A first approach should be to implement a stream
            of carefully-vetted events that represent the one and only means by which the application should be provoked
            into storing a bookmark.

            In order to support SAML authentication in an external WebView, custom code had to be written to extract
